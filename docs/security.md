# Security

Atrium ships with production-grade security defaults:

- Helmet CSP restricting scripts, styles, images, and connections to `'self'`
- CORS locked to a single origin (`WEB_URL`) with credentials
- Global rate limiting (100 requests/min) via `@nestjs/throttler`
- `ValidationPipe` with `whitelist` and `forbidNonWhitelisted` on all endpoints
- Auth guard + roles guard on all non-public routes
- Global exception filter that hides stack traces from clients
- File upload sanitization with blocked dangerous extensions
- Non-root Docker containers
- Required env var validation at startup

## API keys

API keys (`atr_…`) are generated from 32 random bytes and stored only as SHA-256 hashes.
A key is bound to one user and one organization and resolves only while that user is an
owner or admin there. Keys are ignored when a session cookie is present, cannot create
other keys, and are revocable from Settings → API & MCP. The MCP endpoint is rate limited
to 300 requests per minute per key; unauthenticated requests (missing, invalid, or
revoked key) are rate limited to 30 requests per minute per IP address. Both return
`429` with `Retry-After: 60`.
